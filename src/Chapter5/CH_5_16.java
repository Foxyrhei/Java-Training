(Bar Chart Printing Program) One interesting application of computers is to display
graphs and bar charts. Write an application that reads five numbers between 1 and 30. For each
number thatâ€™s read, your program should display the same number of adjacent asterisks.
For example, if your program reads the number 7, it should display *******.
